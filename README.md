<b> Hi, </b>

<h1>Here's my car rental (frontend) application.</h1>

<ul>
-> You can see cars in DB and add new one.

-> You can see users in DB and add new one.

-> You can check car's vin number (at the moment it's mainly working with cars from the USA).

</ul>

<p>
It's my first attempt to frontend. I didn't manage to do more with it. In the future I'm planning to add more functions to it, so it will be on a par with functions that can be found in backend.
</p>

<b>TO RUN FRONTEND APPLICATION</b>

<ol>

-> Start with backend application -> https://github.com/Kacyper/rental-backend

-> Build the project and start CarRentalFrontendApplication.class - it's using local server 8081.

-> Open your browser on localhost:8081.
</ol>
